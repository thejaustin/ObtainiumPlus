            **Fork Version Naming:** `1.2.9-pX` where X = number of commits since fork
            - This release: `-p3` = 3 commits since forking from upstream
            - When merging from upstream, reset to `-p0` and increment with each commit

            ### What's New in This Fork
            - ✨ Collapse categories by default setting
            - 🎨 App renamed to Obtainium+
            - 📝 Documentation for drag-to-reorder (Issue #1)
            - 🔮 Future: Additional sorting methods (Issue #2)

            ### Installation
            Download the appropriate APK for your device:
            - **app-release.apk** - Universal APK (works on all devices, larger size)
            - **app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk** - For 32-bit ARM devices
            - **app-arm64-v8a-release.apk** - For 64-bit ARM devices (most modern phones)
            - **app-x86_64-release.apk** - For x86_64 devices

            ### F-Droid Flavor

            - **app-fdroid-release.apk** - Universal F-Droid build
            - **app-*-fdroid-release.apk** - Split F-Droid builds

            **Note:** These are unsigned APKs built by GitHub Actions.
